### Useful resources

- [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com) 
- [Codepen](https://www.codepen.io) - This is an amazing website which helped me practice and test different ideas. With this website I don't have to worry about HTML templates. I can start by only writing necessary tags without worrying about standart HTML layout. That's really helpful for quick testing. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning HTML, CSS and JS.
